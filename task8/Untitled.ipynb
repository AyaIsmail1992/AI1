    "Robert C. Martin writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "A class should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Reasons to change\" are, in essence, the responsibilities managed by a class or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "(14) Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "“Incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications (to it)”, Uncle Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects should be open for extension, but closed to modification.\n",
    "It should be possible to augment the functionality provided by an object (for example, a class)\n",
    "without changing its internal contracts.\n",
    "An object can enable this when it is designed to be extended cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(15) Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "“Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes \n",
    "without knowing it”, Uncle Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is named after Barbara Liskov, who collaborated with fellow computer scientist Jeannette \n",
    "Wing on the seminal paper *\"A behavioral notion of subtyping\" (1994). A core tenet of the paper is that \n",
    "\"a subtype (must) preserve the behaviour of the supertype methods and also all invariant and history properties \n",
    "of its supertype\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a function accepting a supertype should also accept all its subtypes with no modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "(16) Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "“Keep interfaces small so that users don’t end up depending on things they don’t need.”, Uncle Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several well known object oriented programming languages, like Java and Go, have a concept called interfaces.\n",
    "An interface defines the public methods and properties of an object without implementing them. \n",
    "They are useful when we don't want to couple the signature of a function to a concrete object;\n",
    "we'd rather say \"I don't care what object you give me, as long as it has certain methods and attributes \n",
    "I expect to make use of\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not have interfaces. We have Abstract Base Classes instead, which are a little different, \n",
    "but can serve the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "(17) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "“Depend upon abstractions, not concrete details”, Uncle Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "(18) Don't repeat yourself (DRY)\n",
    "Try to observe the DRY principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it means that there's\n",
    "more than one place to alter something if you need to change some logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: \n",
    "all your tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that you keep this on, \n",
    "then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with tomatoes in them.\n",
    "If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly different things,\n",
    "that share a lot in common, but their differences force you to have two or more separate functions that \n",
    "do much of the same things. Removing duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this\n",
    "set of different things with just one function/module/class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the abstraction right is critical. Bad abstractions can be worse than duplicate code, \n",
    "so be careful! Having said this, if you can make a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, \n",
    "otherwise you'll find yourself updating multiple places any time you want to change one thing.\n",
